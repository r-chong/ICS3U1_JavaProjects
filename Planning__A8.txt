math.random roll dice


if guess is equal to dice:
    statsCorrect += 1
else
    statsIncorrect += 1

statsTotalRolls += 1

output stats
statsCorrect
statsIncorrect
statsTotalRolls
percentCorrect = statsCorrect/statsTotalRolls * 100

example
percCorrect = ((double)totalCorrect/(double)totalRolls)*100;
You have declared percCorrect to be a variable of type double because it is holding the result of a division, but in the equation you are dividing  totalCorrect by totalRolls, and both of these are integers. 
It is tricky to divide two integers and store the result as a double; thatâ€™s why you have to tell Java to treat the integer variables as doubles.

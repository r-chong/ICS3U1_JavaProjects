you wake up in the middle of an island with bruises all over.
the plane. screams. impact.

you don't remember how you got here. raising two fingers it looks like it is an hour from sundown.

you debate whether you should search the island or stay put. They say you should never move far from where you got lost in the wild. Option 1 or 2
> you decide that no one would find you even if you stay in one spot. It's best to find food and possibly shelter. Now should you move east or west?

> you decide to stay put. Best to make camp for the night than risk going out there, wherever there is. Your best option now is to either build a fire or just lie down on the ground. Which will it be?


while walking something catches your eye. It's a dull mirror. Grab it?
> a helicoper flies above the island. you try to signal but there is no way the helicopter will see you. you die instantly from loss of hope. The End.

> a helicopter flies above the island. shakily, you signal with your mirror as it flies out of sight. Suddenly, the helicopter circles back and begins to land. You are saved. The End.
